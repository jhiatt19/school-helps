Get into the folder that has the files saved.
call script "path to pdf" "path to .txt file"

For example: pdf-splitter "/readthistext.pdf" "/tothisplace.txt" 

Pdf-splitter takes the .pdf and turns it into a .txt
Pdf-halfer takes a pdf that has 2 pages like a book and splits it into 2 different .pdf's and then you can use pdf-splitter on it.
